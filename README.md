# 👋 Hi! I'm Juan Carlos Flores Becerra

> "The highest form of understanding is teaching." – Richard Feynman

As a passionate software engineer, I constantly seek out new technologies and knowledge. I believe that the key to mastering any field is by learning deeply and sharing that knowledge with others, much like Feynman's approach to understanding complex subjects. In 2024, I took on the challenge of pursuing two master's degrees simultaneously: one in **Data Science** and another in **DevOps**, because I believe these two disciplines complement each other perfectly in today's tech landscape.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 I am a software engineer with a deep passion for cutting-edge technologies.
- 🎓 Currently pursuing dual master's degrees in **Data Science** and **DevOps**.
- 🤝 My goal is to merge these two fields to design, build, and maintain scalable and efficient **data pipelines**.
- 🌟 Lifelong learner, always eager to explore new ideas and technologies that push the boundaries of innovation.
  
The combination of Data Science and DevOps excites me because it allows for creating robust systems that are not only data-driven but also optimized for performance and scalability in production environments.

## ✨ Hobbies and Interests

Outside of work, I have several hobbies that keep me curious and engaged:

- **Learning**: I'm constantly seeking to expand my knowledge, whether through formal education, online courses, or hands-on experimentation with new tech stacks.
- **Reading**: I'm an avid reader, particularly of science fiction and fantasy. Some of my favorite authors include **J.R.R. Tolkien** (*The Lord of the Rings*), **Brandon Sanderson**, **Stephen King**, and currently, I'm immersed in **Liu Cixin**'s *The Three-Body Problem*.
- **Gaming**: I love playing video games, especially as a long-time fanboy of **Nintendo**. Exploring virtual worlds and solving complex in-game challenges is both relaxing and inspiring to me.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Languages:
- `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Go`, `Ruby`

### Frameworks:
- `Express`, `Node.js`, `Django`

I have experience in both backend and frontend development, but I especially enjoy building scalable backend systems and optimizing application performance.

## 🌱 Technologies I'm Excited to Learn

As I continue my studies, I'm particularly interested in learning more about **AWS services** that enable the development of scalable, data-driven architectures. My goal is to combine my expertise in Data Science and DevOps to build robust, automated **data pipelines** that can efficiently process and analyze vast amounts of information. This skill set will allow me to not only generate valuable insights but also ensure that the infrastructure supporting the data analysis is secure, scalable, and efficient.
